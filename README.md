<br>

>Guido van Rossum is the creator of Python.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Where does the name "Python" come from</summary>
<br>

>The name "Python" comes from the watch reference of the British television series "Monty Python's Flying Circus".
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the Zen of Python</summary>
<br>

>The Zen of Python is a set of design principles for writing elegant and efficient code in Python. It is written as 19 aphorisms and is available by using the "import this" command in python.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use the Python interpreter</summary>
<br>

>To use the Python interpreter, you can open a terminal and enter "python3" to launch the interactive mode, or enter "python3 file_name.py" to run a saved Python script.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to print text and variables using "print"</summary>
<br>

>To print text and variables using print, use the syntax print("text") or print(variable). You can also use print("text", variable) to print text and a variable together.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use strings</summary>
<br>

>In Python, strings can be defined using single or double quotes, for example: my_string = "hello world". Specific characters can be accessed using indexing or slicing can be used to access a range of characters. There are many methods available to manipulate strings.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are indexing and slicing in Python</summary>
<br>

>Python indexing is the access to a specific element of a sequence using the [ ] operator and the element index, example: my_list[2] to access the third element of the "my_list" list. Python cutting is access to a range of elements in a sequence using the [ ] operator and the start and end indices of the desired range.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with "pycodestyle"</summary>
<br>

>The official Python coding style is PEP 8, which defines conventions for indentation, variable names, comments, etc. To check your code with "pycodestyle", run "pycodestyle file_name.py" to check for style errors in your code.

### [Python - if/else, Loops, Functions](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/tree/main/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions)

#### `General`

<details>
<summary>Why indentation is so important in Python</summary>
<br>

>Indentation in Python is used to indicate the level of code nesting, and is critical for the interpreter to properly understand the structure of the program.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use the if, if ... else statements</summary>
<br>

>Use "if" to execute code when a condition is true, "if...else" to choose between two blocks of code based on a condition.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use comments</summary>
<br>

>In Python, comments are created by placing the "#" symbol at the beginning of a line. Anything following the "#" on that line will be ignored by the interpreter.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to affect values to variables</summary>
<br>

>In Python, you can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator "=". Example: x = 5 assigns the value 5 to the variable x.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use the "while" and "for" loops</summary>
<br>

>for: Iterate a predefined number of times. This is also known as a definite iteration  
while: Keep on iterating until the condition is false. This is known as an indefinite iteration
</details>
<details>
<summary>How is Python’s for different from "C"?</summary>
<br>

>C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language. Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Compiled programs execute faster as compared to interpreted programs
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use the "break" and "continues" statements</summary>
<br>

>"break" statement is used to exit a loop early, before the loop has finished all its iterations. "continue" statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next one. Both "break" and "continue" are used within the body of a loop and the execution of the loop is altered based on the statement used.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use "else" clauses on loops</summary>
<br>

>"else" clauses can be used in loops to specify a block of code that will be executed after the loop has finished, but only if the loop completed all its iterations without encountering a "break" statement.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What does the "pass" statement do, and when to use it</summary>
<br>

>The pass statement is used as a placeholder for future code. When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens, but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed. Empty code is not allowed in loops, function definitions, class definitions, or in if statements.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use "range"</summary>
<br>

>"range" is a built-in function in Python that generates a sequence of numbers. The basic syntax for using "range" is range(start, stop, step), where "start" is the first number in the sequence, "stop" is the last number in the sequence and "step" is the difference between each number in the sequence. The returned object is an iterator, which can be used in a for loop or converted to a list using the list() function.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a function and how do you use functions</summary>
<br>

>Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They take input, return output, defined with "def" and are called by name with parameters in parentheses.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What does return a function that does not use any "return" statement</summary>
<br>

>A function that does not use any "return" statement will return "None" by default.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Scope of variables</summary>
<br>

>Scope of a variable refers to the region of the code where it can be accessed. Variables defined inside a function have a local scope and can only be accessed within that function. Variables defined outside of any function have a global scope and can be accessed throughout the program. A variable with the same name can exist in both the global and local scope, but the local variable will take precedence within the function.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What’s a traceback</summary>
<br>

>A traceback is a record of call stack at a certain point in time, showing the sequence of calls that led to an error, including line number and file name. Used for debugging.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them</summary>
<br>

>Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numbers.  
They include:
addition + (ex: 2 + 3)  
subtraction - (ex: 3 - 2)  
multiplication * (ex: 5 * 4)  
division / (ex: 10 / 2)  
modulus - % (returns the remainder of a division) (ex: 7 % 3)  
exponentiation ** (raises a number to a power) (ex: 2 ** 3)  
floor division // (returns the quotient of a division, rounded down to the nearest integer) (ex: 9 // 2)  
</details>

### [Python - Import & Modules](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/tree/main/0x02-python-import_modules)

#### `General`

<details>
<summary>How to import functions from another file</summary>
<br>

>Import functions from another file by using "import file_name" or "from file_name import function_name".
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use imported functions</summary>
<br>

>Use imported functions by referencing it with the imported file name and dot operator file_name.function_name() or directly function_name()
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to create a module</summary>
<br>

>To create a module in Python, create a .py file and define functions, variables, and other elements. To use the module in another file, use the import statement followed by the file name (without the .py extension).
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use the built-in function dir()</summary>
<br>

>The built-in function dir() lists all the names of the members of a module or object. It takes an object or module as an argument and returns a list of strings containing the names of the members of this object or module.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported</summary>
<br>

>To prevent code in your script from being executed when imported, use an if __name__ == "__main__": statement around your code. This code will only be executed when the script is run directly and not when it is imported.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use command line arguments with your Python programs</summary>
<br>

>To use command line arguments with your Python programs, use the sys library and access the sys.argv list. This list contains the command line arguments passed when the script is run.
</details>

### [Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/tree/main/0x03-python-data_structures)

#### `General`

<details>
<summary>What are lists and how to use them</summary>
<br>

>In Python, lists are ordered collections of items which can be of any type (numbers, strings, etc.). They can be created using square brackets [ ] and items are separated by commas. Lists can be accessed, added, removed, and iterated through.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists</summary>
<br>

>Strings and lists are both data types in Python, but they have different characteristics. 
Strings are sequences of characters that cannot be modified once created. Lists are mutable collections of items of different types.
Similarities are that they can both be iterated through and have methods to access their elements.  
In summary, strings are immutable sequences of characters, lists are mutable collections of items of different types but they can both be iterated through and have methods to access their elements.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them</summary>
<br>

>The most commonly used methods on lists in Python are:

- `append()`: to add an item to the end of the list
- `insert()`: to insert an item at a specific position
- `remove()`: to remove an item
- `pop()`: to remove and return the item at a specific position or at the end of the list
- `index()`: to find the index of an item
- `count()`: to count the number of occurrences of an item
- `sort()`: to sort the items
- `reverse()`: to reverse the order of the items
</details>
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use lists as stacks and queues</summary>
<br>

>Lists can be used as a stack or a queue by using the appropriate methods.
To use a list as a stack, the append() method is used to add an item on top of the stack and pop() method is used to remove an item from the top of the stack.
To use a list as a queue, the append() method is used to add an item to the end of the queue and pop(0) method is used to remove an item from the front of the queue.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are list comprehensions and how to use them</summary>
<br>

>List comprehensions in Python are a concise and efficient way to create lists. They allow creating a new list by applying an operation to each element of another list or another iterable data type.

They are written in the following format:

```python
my_list = [expression for item in iterable]
```

or

```python
my_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>What are tuples and how to use them</summary>
<br>

>Tuples in Python are like lists but immutable, meaning that once created, they cannot be modified. They are defined using parentheses ( ) and elements are separated by commas. You can access elements of a tuple using indices and use slicing, but you can't use methods that modify the tuple. They can be used to store data that should not be modified.
</details>
<details>
<summary>When to use tuples versus lists</summary>
<br>

>Use tuples when data should not be modified, use lists when data needs to be modified.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a sequence</summary>
<br>

>In Python, sequences are ordered sets of elements such as lists or tuples that have common methods and can be used to store and manipulate data in programs. Lists are mutable, tuples are immutable.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is tuple packing</summary>
<br>

>Tuple packaging in Python is a way to create a tuple by assigning several variables to a tuple in a single instruction. This makes it possible to group data into a single object for easy handling and better readability of the code.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is sequence unpacking</summary>
<br>

>Sequence unpacking is a feature in Python that allows you to assign multiple variables to the elements of a sequence, such as a list or tuple, in one line of code. This is useful when you want to extract multiple values from a sequence and assign them to separate variables.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the del statement and how to use it</summary>
<br>

>The "del" statement in Python is used to delete variables or elements from a list or dictionary. To use "del", you specify the object you want to delete, such as "del variable" or "del list[index]". You can also use "del" to remove elements from a dictionary by using "del dictionary[key]". It's important to note that once you have used "del" to delete a variable or element, it is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.

### [Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/tree/main/0x04-python-more_data_structures)

#### `General`

<details>
<summary>What are sets and how to use them</summary>
<br>

>Sets are a data structure in Python that store unique values. They are similar to lists and dictionaries but do not allow duplicate values. To use sets, you can use the "set( )" function to create an empty set, or use curly braces "{ }", like in "my_set = {1, 2, 3}". Sets are useful for operations such as adding, removing, and checking for the presence of an element.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are the most common methods of set and how to use them</summary>
<br>

>The most common methods of sets in Python are:  
- `add()` to add an element to the set.  
- `remove()` to remove an element from the set.  
- `union()` to combine two sets.  
- `intersection()` to get the elements that are in both sets.  
- 'difference()' to get the elements that are in one set but not the other.  
- `clear()` to empty the set.  
- `pop()` to remove a random element from the set.  
  
>To use these methods, you first need to create a set, then use the dot notation to access the method, for example "my_set.add(element)" to add an element to the set.  
</details>
<details>
<summary>When to use sets versus lists</summary>
<br>

>It is best to use sets when you need to store unique values and you want to perform operations such as adding, removing, and checking for the presence of an element. Lists are better when you need to store elements in a specific order and you want to perform operations such as iteration, indexing, and slicing.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to iterate into a set</summary>
<br>

>To iterate through a set, you can use a for loop and the set's iterator. The set's iterator returns each element of the set in an arbitrary order. You can use the for loop to iterate through the set and access each element, like this: "for element in my_set: print(element)".  
You can also use the set method .items() to obtain a set view of the elements that you can iterate through.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are dictionaries and how to use them</summary>
<br>

>Dictionaries are Python data structures that store key-value pairs. To use them, use curly braces "{ }" to create an empty dictionary or define key-value pairs, like in "my_dictionary = {'key': 'value'}". Access values using keys, like in "my_dictionary['key']".   Dictionaries are useful for storing data indexed by a unique key.
</details>
<details>
<summary>When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets</summary>
<br>

>Use dictionaries when you need to store data indexed by a unique key and need quick access to that data using that key. Use lists when you need to store elements in a specific order and perform operations such as iteration, indexing, and slicing. Use sets when you need to store unique values and perform operations such as adding, removing, and checking for the presence of an element.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a key in a dictionary</summary>
<br>

>A key in a dictionary is an unique identifier associated with a value, that can be used to access the value.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to iterate over a dictionary</summary>
<br>

>To iterate over a dictionary, use a for loop to iterate through the dictionary's keys, and use the keys to access the values. For example: "for key in my_dict: print(my_dict[key])" or use the method .items() to obtain a view of the key-value pairs that you can iterate through.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a lambda function</summary>
<br>

>A lambda function is a small, anonymous function in Python that is defined using the "lambda" keyword. It can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. It is used to create small, throwaway functions.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are the map, reduce and filter functions</summary>
<br>

>map(), reduce() and filter() are built-in functions in Python that are used to perform operations on sequences such as lists and tuples. map() applies a function to all items in a sequence and returns a new sequence. reduce() applies a function to all items in a sequence and returns a single value. filter() filters items in a sequence based on a given condition and returns a new sequence.
</details>

-----------------------------------

### [Python - Exceptions](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/tree/main/0x05-python-exceptions)

#### `General`

<details>
<summary>What’s the difference between errors and exceptions</summary>
<br>

>Errors are problems that occur during the compilation of a program. Exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program.  
Exceptions are runtime errors, and can be handled, while Errors cannot be handled.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are exceptions and how to use them</summary>
<br>

>Exceptions are runtime errors in Python, which can be handled using try-except blocks. You use the try block to enclose the code that might raise an exception, and use the except block to handle the exception. You can also use the finally block to include code that should be executed regardless of whether an exception is raised. To raise an exception, you use the raise keyword.
</details>
<details>
<summary>When do we need to use exceptions</summary>
<br>

>Exceptions are used to handle runtime errors in Python. They are used to handle unexpected situations or inputs, such as file not found, network errors, divide by zero, and so on. They are also used to validate inputs and handle edge cases. Exceptions are useful in preventing the program from crashing and instead gracefully handle the errors.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to correctly handle an exception</summary>
<br>

>To correctly handle an exception, you should use a try-except block, placing the code that might raise the exception in the try block, and the code to handle the exception in the except block. The except block should be specific to the type of exception you are trying to handle. It's recommended to include a finally block to include any code that should be executed regardless of whether an exception is raised.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What’s the purpose of catching exceptions</summary>
<br>

>The purpose of catching exceptions is to handle runtime errors in a graceful way, by providing a mechanism to handle the error and continue the execution of the program rather than crashing. This allows the program to continue running, or to terminate gracefully, and can also provide a way to notify the user or log the error.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to raise a builtin exception</summary>
<br>

>To raise a built-in exception in Python, you can use the "raise" keyword followed by the exception type, and an optional message. For example: "raise ValueError("Invalid input")" will raise a ValueError exception with the message "Invalid input".
You can also raise an exception without any argument, like this : "raise ValueError"
</details>
<details>
<summary>When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception</summary>
<br>

>A clean-up action should be implemented after an exception when there are resources that need to be released or closed, such as file handles, database connections, network connections, etc. This ensures that these resources are not left in an undefined state, and can prevent memory leaks and other issues. It's a best practice to include a finally block in the try-except block to include any clean-up actions that should be executed regardless of whether an exception is raised.
</details>
