## Description
>Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. It was first created in 1989 by Guido van Rossum. It is known for its clear and concise syntax, ease of use and large developer community. It is used in many fields such as data science, machine learning, robotics, web development, game development, etc. It is also used for developing scripts to automate common tasks and for creating small to medium-sized programs. Python supports multiple programming paradigms such as object-oriented programming, procedural programming and functional programming. It is also compatible with many operating systems including Windows, MacOS and Linux.

#### `General`

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/gwuqSZXS7ElRbiObQzDcTg), **without the help of Google:**

<details>
<summary>Why indentation is so important in Python</summary>
<br>

>Indentation is important in Python because it is used to define blocks of code. In Python, unlike in many other programming languages, whitespace (indentation) is used to indicate the scope and structure of the code, rather than brackets or keywords.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use the if, if ... else statements</summary>
<br>

>The if statement is used in Python to execute code only if a certain condition is met. The if...else statement is used to execute different code blocks depending on whether the condition is met or not.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use comments</summary>
<br>

>In Python, comments are lines of text that are ignored by the interpreter and are used to explain the code for human readers. Comments start with a pound (#) symbol.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to affect values to variables</summary>
<br>

>Variables in Python are assigned values using the equal sign (=). For example, `x = 10` assigns the value 10 to the variable x.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use the "while" and "for" loops</summary>
<br>

>The while loop is used in Python to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is met. The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence, such as a list or a range of numbers, and execute a block of code for each element in the sequence.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How is Python’s for different from "C"?</summary>
<br>

>Python's for loop is different from C's for loop in that it can iterate over any sequence, such as lists, tuples, and ranges, and doesn't require an explicit counter.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use the "break" and "continues" statements</summary>
<br>

>The break statement is used to exit a loop early, while the continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next one.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use "else" clauses on loops</summary>
<br>

>The else clause on a loop can be used to execute code after the loop has completed, but only if the loop completed normally (i.e. not with a break statement).
</details>
<details>
<summary>What does the "pass" statement do, and when to use it</summary>
<br>

>The pass statement is a placeholder statement in Python and does nothing. It is used when a statement is required syntactically, but no action is required.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use "range"</summary>
<br>

>The range function is used to generate a sequence of numbers, which can be used as the input for a for loop.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a function and how do you use functions</summary>
<br>

>A function in Python is a reusable block of code that takes inputs and returns an output. Functions are defined using the def keyword and can be called by their name.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What does return a function that does not use any "return" statement</summary>
<br>

>A function that does not use a return statement returns None.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Scope of variables</summary>
<br>

>The scope of a variable refers to the part of the program where the variable can be accessed. In Python, variables have either local or global scope.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What’s a traceback</summary>
<br>

>A traceback is a record of the functions that were called leading up to an error. It is displayed as a stack trace and is used to help diagnose the cause of an error.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them</summary>
<br>

>The arithmetic operators in Python include + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), // (floor division), % (modulus), ** (exponentiation), and others. These operators can be used to perform mathematical operations on variables and values in Python.

### [Python - Import & Modules](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/tree/main/0x02-python-import_modules)
#### `General`

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/gwuqSZXS7ElRbiObQzDcTg), **without the help of Google:**

<details>
<summary>How to import functions from another file</summary>
<br>

>To import functions from another file in Python, you can use the `import` statement followed by the name of the module you want to import. For example, to import a function named `my_function` from a file named `my_module.py`, you would write `import my_module` and then use `my_module.my_function()` to call the function.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use imported functions</summary>
<br>

>To use imported functions in Python, simply call the function by its name, preceded by the name of the module it was imported from. For example, if you imported a function `my_function` from a module `my_module`, you would call it using `my_module.my_function()`.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to create a module</summary>
<br>

>To create a module in Python, simply create a new .py file with the desired code and functions. Then, the functions can be imported into other Python scripts by using the `import` statement, as described above.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use the built-in function dir()</summary>
<br>

>The built-in function `dir()` in Python can be used to see a list of all the names (attributes) defined in an object, including functions and variables. For example, you can call `dir(module_name)` to see a list of all the functions and variables defined in a module.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported</summary>
<br>

>To prevent code in your script from being executed when imported, use an `if __name__ == "__main__":` statement around your code. This code will only be executed when the script is run directly and not when it is imported.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use command line arguments with your Python programs</summary>
<br>

>To use command line arguments with your Python programs, you can use the `sys.argv` list, which contains the command line arguments passed to the script. For example, if you want to access the first argument passed to your script, you would use `sys.argv[1]`. You can import the `sys` module by writing `import sys` at the top of your script.
</details>

### [Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/tree/main/0x03-python-data_structures)
#### `General`

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/gwuqSZXS7ElRbiObQzDcTg), **without the help of Google:**

<details>
<summary>What are lists and how to use them</summary>
<br>

>Lists in Python are ordered collections of items, which can be of any data type (e.g. strings, integers, objects, etc.). Lists are created using square brackets `[ ]` and items are separated by commas. For example, `my_list = [1, 2, 3]` creates a list of integers.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists</summary>
<br>

>Strings and lists are similar in that they are both sequences of items. However, strings are immutable (cannot be changed), while lists are mutable (can be changed). This means that you can modify the items in a list, but you cannot modify the characters in a string.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them</summary>
<br>

>Lists have many built-in methods for manipulating and accessing their items, such as `append()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `index()`, and `count()`. For example, you can append an item to a list using `my_list.append(4)`, and you can access an item at a specific index using `my_list[0]` (which returns the first item in the list).
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use lists as stacks and queues</summary>
<br>

>Lists can be used as stacks (last-in, first-out) by using the `append()` and `pop()` methods, and as queues (first-in, first-out) by using the `append()` and `pop(0)` methods.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are list comprehensions and how to use them</summary>
<br>

>List comprehensions are a concise way to create new lists based on existing lists. For example, the following list comprehension creates a new list with the squares of the numbers in an existing list: `squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in my_list]`.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are tuples and how to use them</summary>
<br>

>Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable and can be thought of as read-only lists. Tuples are created using parentheses `( )` instead of square brackets `[ ]`, and items are separated by commas. For example, `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)` creates a tuple of integers.
</details>
<details>
<summary>When to use tuples versus lists</summary>
<br>

>Tuples are generally faster than lists for accessing items and are often used for short sequences of items that are not meant to be modified. On the other hand, lists are more flexible and are often used for longer sequences of items that are meant to be modified.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a sequence</summary>
<br>

>A sequence in Python is any collection of items, ordered by their position in the sequence. Both lists and tuples are examples of sequences.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is tuple packing</summary>
<br>

>Tuple packing is the process of creating a tuple by grouping together multiple items. For example, `my_tuple = 1, 2, 3` creates a tuple of integers.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is sequence unpacking</summary>
<br>

>Sequence unpacking is the process of extracting the items in a sequence and assigning them to separate variables. For example, `a, b, c = my_tuple` assigns the first item in `my_tuple` to `a`, the second item to `b`, and the third item to `c`.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the 'del' statement and how to use it</summary>
<br>

>The `del` statement in Python can be used to delete variables or items from a collection. For example, `del my_list[0]` deletes the first item in the list `my_list`.
</details>

### [Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/tree/main/0x04-python-more_data_structures)
#### `General`

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/gwuqSZXS7ElRbiObQzDcTg), **without the help of Google:**

<details>
<summary>What are sets and how to use them</summary>
<br>

>Sets are collection data types in Python that are unordered and unchangeable. To use sets, you can create a set by enclosing a comma-separated list of elements in curly braces `{ }` or use the `set()` function.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are the most common methods of set and how to use them</summary>
<br>

>The most common methods of sets include `union()`, `intersection()`, `difference()`, `add()`, `remove()`, and `clear()`.
</details>
<details>
<summary>When to use sets versus lists</summary>
<br>

>Use sets when you need to store multiple items in a collection and do not care about the order and duplicates are not allowed. Use lists when order matters and duplicates are allowed.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to iterate into a set</summary>
<br>

>To iterate into a set, you can use a for loop.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are dictionaries and how to use them</summary>
<br>

>Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs in Python. To use dictionaries, you can create a dictionary using curly braces `{ }` and colons to separate keys from values.
</details>
<details>
<summary>When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets</summary>
<br>

>Use dictionaries when you need to associate values with keys, for example to store the properties of an object. Use lists or sets when you need to store items but don't care about associating them with keys.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a key in a dictionary</summary>
<br>

>A key in a dictionary is a unique identifier that is used to access the value associated with it.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to iterate over a dictionary</summary>
<br>

>To iterate over a dictionary, use the `items()` method or loop through the keys using the `keys()` method and access the values using the keys as index.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a lambda function</summary>
<br>

>A lambda function is a small anonymous function in Python, often used as an inline function. It can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are the map, reduce and filter functions</summary>
<br>

>The `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions are built-in Python functions that are used to manipulate lists. The `map()` function applies a given function to each item in a list. The `reduce()` function applies a given function to the items of a list to produce a single output. The `filter()` function filters the elements of a list based on a given function.
</details>

-----------------------------------

### [Python - Exceptions](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/tree/main/0x05-python-exceptions)
#### `General`

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/gwuqSZXS7ElRbiObQzDcTg), **without the help of Google:**

<details>
<summary>What’s the difference between errors and exceptions</summary>
<br>

>The difference between errors and exceptions is that errors indicate a problem with the code itself, while exceptions are unexpected events that occur during the execution of a program and can be handled.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are exceptions and how to use them</summary>
<br>

>Exceptions are events that change the normal flow of a program and require specific action to be taken. They can be `raised` using the raise keyword and can be caught using the `try` and `except` blocks.
</details>
<details>
<summary>When do we need to use exceptions</summary>
<br>

>We need to use exceptions when we want to handle unexpected events in our program, such as a user inputting an invalid value or a network connection failure.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to correctly handle an exception</summary>
<br>

>To correctly handle an exception, we should wrap the code that might raise an exception in a `try` block and provide an `except` block to handle the exception. The `except` block should specify which exception it is handling and provide the necessary action to be taken.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What’s the purpose of catching exceptions</summary>
<br>

>The purpose of catching exceptions is to provide a way to handle unexpected events and prevent the program from crashing. By catching an exception, we can take appropriate action, such as informing the user of the error or attempting to recover from the error.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to raise a builtin exception</summary>
<br>

>To raise a built-in exception, we can use the `raise` keyword followed by the type of the exception and an optional message. For example, `raise ValueError("Invalid value")`.
</details>
<details>
<summary>When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception</summary>
<br>

>We need to implement a clean-up action after an exception if there are any resources, such as files or connections, that need to be closed or released regardless of whether an exception occurs. This can be done using a `finally` block, which will run after the `try` block and any `except` blocks.
</details>

</details>
<details>
<summary>“first-class everything”</summary>
<br>

>The term "first-class everything" in Python means that functions, classes, and objects are treated as first-class citizens. This means that they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to functions, and returned as values from functions, just like any other data type.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a class</summary>
<br>

>In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is an object and an instance</summary>
<br>

>An object is an instance of a class and is created by calling the class as if it were a function. An instance is a specific occurrence of an object.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the difference between a class and an object or instance</summary>
<br>

>The difference between a class and an object or instance is that a class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object or instance is a specific occurrence of a class.
</details>
<details>

<br>

>An attribute is a value that is associated with an object or a class. It can be a variable or a function that belongs to an object or a class.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes</summary>
<br>

>Public, protected, and private attributes in Python are determined by the naming convention. Attributes that start with an underscore are considered private, while those with two underscores are considered protected. Attributes that don't have any underscores are public.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is self</summary>
<br>

>The self parameter in a method is a reference to the instance of the object that the method is called on. It is used to access the attributes and methods of the class.

</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the special __init__ method and how to use it</summary>
<br>

>The special init method is a constructor method that is called when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize the attributes of an object.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding</summary>
<br>

>Data Abstraction refers to the ability of an object to hide its internal details from the outside world and only reveal the necessary information. Data Encapsulation refers to the wrapping of data and functions into a single unit. Information Hiding refers to the practice of keeping the implementation details of a class hidden from the user.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a property</summary>
<br>

>A property in Python is a special kind of attribute that provides a way to access and manipulate an object's attributes in a more convenient way.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python</summary>
<br>

>The difference between an attribute and a property in Python is that an attribute is a basic variable or function, while a property provides a way to access and manipulate an object's attributes in a more convenient way.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python</summary>
<br>

>The Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python is to use the `@property` and `@<attribute>.setter` decorators.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class</summary>
<br>

>You can dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class by simply assigning a value to a new attribute name.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to bind attributes to object and classes</summary>
<br>

>Attributes can be bound to object and classes by using the self keyword in methods within a class or by using the `setattr` function.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the __dict__ of a class and/or instance of a class and what does it contain</summary>
<br>

>The dict of a class and/or instance of a class contains the attributes and methods of the class or instance as key-value pairs.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How does Python find the attributes of an object or class</summary>
<br>

>Python finds the attributes of an object or class by searching the object's namespace and its class's namespace. If it doesn't find the attribute in either namespace, it will raise an AttributeError.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use the getattr function</summary>
<br>

>The `getattr` function is used in Python to access an object's attributes, even if the attribute name is not known until runtime. The function takes two arguments: the object and the name of the attribute as a string. If the attribute exists, its value is returned. If the attribute doesn't exist, a default value can be returned or an AttributeError can be raised.

<details>
<summary>What’s an interactive test</summary>
<br>

>An interactive test is a test that can be executed by the user and requires input or interaction to evaluate the output.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Why tests are important</summary>
<br>

>Tests are important because they help ensure that the code is functioning as expected, especially when making changes to the code. Tests help catch bugs early in the development process, making it easier and faster to fix them.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to write Docstrings to create tests</summary>
<br>

>To write Docstrings to create tests, you can include test cases as docstrings within the functions or modules. The tests can be written using the doctest module, which allows you to write tests as part of the documentation.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to write documentation for each module and function</summary>
<br>

>Documentation for each module and function can be written using docstrings, which provide information about the purpose and usage of the code. Good documentation helps others understand your code and reduces the need for them to ask questions.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are the basic option flags to create tests</summary>
<br>

>The basic option flags to create tests are `-v` for verbose output, `-k` for test selection, and `-x` for stopping after first failure.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to find edge cases</summary>
<br>

>To find edge cases, you can think about and test the boundaries of the inputs and outputs, extreme cases, and any unusual or unexpected scenarios. It's important to test edge cases to make sure the code is robust and can handle unexpected inputs.

>`Self` is a special keyword in Python that refers to the instance of the object that a method is being called on. It is used to access attributes and other methods of the object.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a method</summary>
<br>

>A method is a function that is associated with an object or class, and operates on or with the attributes of that object or class.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the special __init__ method and how to use it</summary>
<br>

>The special `init` method is a special method that is called automatically when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize attributes and perform any other setup that the object needs.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding</summary>
<br>

>Data Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class and exposing only the necessary information to the outside world. Data Encapsulation is the technique of wrapping data and methods into a single unit, or object, to provide a secure way of accessing the data. Information Hiding is the practice of hiding the internal details of an object and exposing a public interface to the outside world.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a property</summary>
<br>

>A property is a special kind of attribute in Python, which provides a convenient way to access, control, and manipulate the attributes of an object, such as getting or setting values, or adding constraints or restrictions.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python</summary>
<br>

>The difference between an attribute and a property in Python is that an attribute is a variable associated with an object or class, while a property is a method used to access or modify the attribute.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python</summary>
<br>

>The Pythonic way to write getters and setters is to use the `@property` and `@attribute.setter` decorators.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are the special __str__ and __repr__ methods and how to use them</summary>
<br>

>The special `str` and `repr` methods are used to define how an object should be represented as a string. `str` is meant to return a human-readable representation of the object, while `repr` should return a string representation that could be used to recreate the object.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the difference between __str__ and __repr__</summary>
<br>

>The difference between `str` and `repr` is that `str` is meant to be a readable representation of the object for the user, while `repr` is meant to be an unambiguous representation of the object for debugging and development purposes.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a class attribute</summary>
<br>

>A class attribute is a variable associated with the class, rather than a specific instance of the class.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the difference between a object attribute and a class attribute</summary>
<br>

>The difference between an object attribute and a class attribute is that an object attribute is associated with a specific instance of the class, while a class attribute is associated with the class as a whole.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a class method</summary>
<br>

>A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a static method</summary>
<br>

>A static method is a method that is not bound to the instance or the class, but instead has no connection to either.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class</summary>
<br>

>To dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class, you can use the setattr function.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to bind attributes to object and classes</summary>
<br>

>To bind attributes to objects and classes, you can simply assign a value to the attribute name.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is and what does contain __dict__ of a class and of an instance of a class</summary>
<br>

>`dict` of a class contains the names and values of the class's attributes, while `dict` of an instance of a class contains the names and values of the instance's attributes.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How does Python find the attributes of an object or class</summary>
<br>

>Python finds the attributes of an object or class by looking in the object's or class's `dict`, and then in its parent class's `dict` if the attribute is not found.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use the getattr function</summary>
<br>

>The `getattr` function is used to access the value of an attribute, even if the attribute does not exist.

#### `General`

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/gwuqSZXS7ElRbiObQzDcTg), **without the help of Google:**

<details>
<summary>What is an object</summary>
<br>

>An object in programming is a specific instance of a data structure defined by a class. It contains data and behavior (methods) that operate on that data. Objects are the fundamental building blocks of object-oriented programming (OOP).
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the difference between a class and an object or instance</summary>
<br>

>A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors that objects of that class will have. An object, also known as an instance, is a specific realization of a class. For example, if you have a class for creating a dog, then each dog you create would be an instance of that class.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object</summary>
<br>

>An `immutable object` is an object whose state cannot be changed after it is created. For example, a string in Python is an immutable object because once you create a string, you cannot change the characters in it. On the other hand, a `mutable object` is an object whose state can be changed after it is created. For example, a list in Python is a mutable object because you can add, remove, or change elements in a list after it is created.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a reference</summary>
<br>

>A reference is a value that refers to an object in memory. It is a way to access the object and its data. In Python, variables are references to objects.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is an assignment</summary>
<br>

>An assignment is the process of assigning a value to a variable. In Python, you use the equal sign (=) to perform an assignment. For example: `x = 5` assigns the value 5 to the variable `x`.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is an alias</summary>
<br>

>An alias is a second reference to an existing object. If two variables refer to the same object, they are said to be aliases of each other.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to know if two variables are identical</summary>
<br>

>To know if two variables are identical, you can use the `is` operator in Python. The is operator returns `True` if the variables refer to the same object, and `False` otherwise. For example: `x is y` returns `True` if `x` and `y` refer to the same object.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to know if two variables are linked to the same object</summary>
<br>

>To know if two variables are linked to the same object, you can use the `==` operator in Python. The `==` operator returns `True` if the objects referred to by the variables have the same value, and `False` otherwise. For example: `x == y` returns `True` if the values of `x` and `y` are equal.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)</summary>
<br>

>To display the variable identifier (memory address) in CPython, you can use the built-in `id()` function. For example: `id(x)` returns the memory address of the object referred to by `x`.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is mutable and immutable</summary>
<br>

>Mutable and immutable are terms used to describe the state of an object. An immutable object is one whose state cannot be changed after it is created, while a mutable object is one whose state can be changed after it is created.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are the built-in mutable types</summary>
<br>

>The built-in mutable types in Python include lists, dictionaries, sets, and bytearrays.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are the built-in immutable types</summary>
<br>

>The built-in immutable types in Python include numbers (integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers), strings, tuples, and frozensets.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How does Python pass variables to functions</summary>
<br>

>In Python, variables are passed to functions by reference. This means that when a function receives a variable, it receives a reference to the object referred to by that variable. If the function modifies the object, the changes will be visible outside the function as well. If you want to pass an object to a function such that the function cannot modify it, you should pass an immutable object.

### [Python - Inheritance](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/tree/main/0x0A-python-inheritance)
#### `General`

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/gwuqSZXS7ElRbiObQzDcTg), **without the help of Google:**

<details>
<summary>What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass</summary>
<br>

>A superclass, baseclass, or parentclass is a higher-level class from which other classes inherit attributes and methods. In other words, a subclass inherits from its parent class.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a subclass</summary>
<br>

>A subclass is a lower-level class that inherits attributes and methods from a parent class (also known as a superclass or baseclass). The subclass can add or override attributes and methods of the parent class.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance</summary>
<br>

>To list all attributes and methods of a class or instance, you can use the built-in `dir()` function in Python. For example, `dir(ClassName)` will return a list of all attributes and methods of the class `ClassName`. To list the attributes and methods of an instance, you can simply use `dir(instance)`.
</details>
<details>
<summary>When can an instance have new attributes</summary>
<br>

>An instance can have new attributes at any time. You can add new attributes to an instance simply by assigning a value to a new attribute name. For example, `instance.new_attribute = value` adds a new attribute `new_attribute` to the instance with the value `value`.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to inherit class from another</summary>
<br>

>To inherit a class from another, you use the syntax `class SubclassName(ParentClassName)` in Python. The subclass inherits all attributes and methods from the parent class.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to define a class with multiple base classes</summary>
<br>

>To define a class with multiple base classes, you use multiple parent classes in the parentheses when defining the class. For example: `class SubclassName(ParentClass1, ParentClass2, ParentClass3)`. The subclass inherits attributes and methods from all parent classes.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the default class every class inherit from</summary>
<br>

>Every class in Python implicitly inherits from the `object` class. The `object` class is the root of the class hierarchy in Python, and all classes inherit from it by default.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class</summary>
<br>

>To override a method or attribute in a subclass, simply declare a new method or attribute with the same name in the subclass. The new method or attribute in the subclass will overwrite or replace the original method or attribute defined in the parent class. This allows the subclass to have its own implementation of a method or attribute, while still inheriting the rest of the attributes and methods from the parent class.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses</summary>
<br>

>All attributes and methods that are defined in a parent class are available for use by subclasses. Subclasses can access these attributes and methods using the dot operator, for example `Subclass.attribute` or `Subclass.method().`
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the purpose of inheritance</summary>
<br>

>The purpose of inheritance is to allow a subclass to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class, thus avoiding the need to rewrite the same code in multiple classes. Inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, where lower-level classes inherit attributes and methods from higher-level classes, making it easier to reuse code and create more specialized classes.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type and super built-in functions</summary>
<br>

>The built-in functions `isinstance()`, `issubclass()`, `type()`, and `super()` are used for testing the type

<details>
<summary>How to open a file</summary>
<br>

>To open a file in Python, you can use the built-in `open()` function. This function takes the file name as an argument and returns a file object that you can use to read or write the file. The second argument to the `open()` function specifies the mode in which to open the file. In this case, `"r"` means "read".Here's an example:

```python
file = open("example.txt", "r") # open the file for reading
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to write text in a file</summary>
<br>

>To write to a file, you can use the `write()` method of the file object. Here's an example:

```python
file = open("example.txt", "w") # open the file for writing
file.write("This is some text.") # write text to the file
file.close() # close the file
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to read the full content of a file</summary>
<br>

>To read the entire contents of a file, you can use the `read()` method of the file object. Here's an example:

```python
file = open("example.txt", "r") # open the file for reading
content = file.read() # read the entire contents of the file
print(content) # print the contents
file.close() # close the file
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to read a file line by line</summary>
<br>

>To read a file line by line, you can use a `for` loop and the `readline()` method of the file object. Here's an example:

```python
file = open("example.txt", "r") # open the file for reading
for line in file:
    print(line)
file.close() # close the file
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to move the cursor in a file</summary>
<br>

>The position of the cursor in a file can be changed using the `seek()` method of the file object. This method takes an offset (in bytes) as an argument, and moves the cursor to the specified position. Here's an example:

```python
file = open("example.txt", "r") # open the file for reading
print(file.tell()) # print the current position of the cursor
file.seek(10) # move the cursor to the 10th byte
print(file.tell()) # print the current position of the cursor
file.close() # close the file
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to make sure a file is closed after using it</summary>
<br>

>It's important to close a file after you're done using it to release the resources it was using and to prevent corruption of the file's contents. You can close a file using the `close()` method of the file object. Here's an example:

```python
file = open("example.txt", "r") # open the file for reading
# do some file operations
file.close() # close the file
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is and how to use the with statement</summary>
<br>

>The `with` statement is used in Python to ensure that a resource is automatically released when it's no longer needed. When used with a file, it automatically closes the file when the block of code inside the `with` statement is finished. Here's an example:

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is JSON</summary>
<br>

>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language, and is commonly used to transmit data between a server and a web application. JSON data is represented as key-value pairs, similar to a dictionary in Python.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is serialization</summary>
<br>

>Serialization is the process of converting a data structure into a format that can be stored or transmitted across a network. The goal of serialization is to convert the state of an object into a form that can be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is deserialization</summary>
<br>

>Deserialization is the reverse process of serialization, where data is converted from a string representation back into its original data structure. The goal of deserialization is to reconstruct the original object from the serialized form.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string</summary>
<br>

>To convert a Python data structure to a JSON string, you can use the `json` module in Python. The `json.dumps()` function converts a Python object into a JSON-formatted string. Here's an example:

```python
import json

data = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
json_string = json.dumps(data, indent=4)
print(json_string)
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure</summary>
<br>

>To convert a JSON string to a Python data structure, you can use the `json` module in Python. The `json.loads()` function converts a JSON-formatted string into a Python object. Here's an example:

```python
import json

json_string = '{"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}'
data = json.loads(json_string)
print(data)
```
