## Description
>Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. It was first created in 1989 by Guido van Rossum. It is known for its clear and concise syntax, ease of use and large developer community. It is used in many fields such as data science, machine learning, robotics, web development, game development, etc. It is also used for developing scripts to automate common tasks and for creating small to medium-sized programs. Python supports multiple programming paradigms such as object-oriented programming, procedural programming and functional programming. It is also compatible with many operating systems including Windows, MacOS and Linux.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Who created Python</summary>
<br>

>Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1989.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Who is Guido van Rossum</summary>
<br>

>Guido van Rossum is the creator of Python.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Where does the name "Python" come from</summary>
<br>

>The name "Python" comes from the watch reference of the British television series "Monty Python's Flying Circus".
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the Zen of Python</summary>
<br>

>The Zen of Python is a set of design principles for writing elegant and efficient code in Python. It is written as 19 aphorisms and is available by using the "import this" command in python.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use the Python interpreter</summary>
<br>

>To use the Python interpreter, you can open a terminal and enter "python3" to launch the interactive mode, or enter "python3 file_name.py" to run a saved Python script.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to print text and variables using "print"</summary>
<br>

>To print text and variables using print, use the syntax print("text") or print(variable). You can also use print("text", variable) to print text and a variable together.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use strings</summary>
<br>

>In Python, strings can be defined using single or double quotes, for example: my_string = "hello world". Specific characters can be accessed using indexing or slicing can be used to access a range of characters. There are many methods available to manipulate strings.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are indexing and slicing in Python</summary>
<br>

>Python indexing is the access to a specific element of a sequence using the [ ] operator and the element index, example: my_list[2] to access the third element of the "my_list" list. Python cutting is access to a range of elements in a sequence using the [ ] operator and the start and end indices of the desired range.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with "pycodestyle"</summary>
<br>

>The official Python coding style is PEP 8, which defines conventions for indentation, variable names, comments, etc. To check your code with "pycodestyle", run "pycodestyle file_name.py" to check for style errors in your code.
</details>

### [Python - if/else, Loops, Functions](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/tree/main/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions)

#### `General`

<details>
<summary>Why indentation is so important in Python</summary>
<br>

>Indentation in Python is used to indicate the level of code nesting, and is critical for the interpreter to properly understand the structure of the program.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use the if, if ... else statements</summary>
<br>

>Use "if" to execute code when a condition is true, "if...else" to choose between two blocks of code based on a condition.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use comments</summary>
<br>

>In Python, comments are created by placing the "#" symbol at the beginning of a line. Anything following the "#" on that line will be ignored by the interpreter.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to affect values to variables</summary>
<br>

>In Python, you can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator "=". Example: x = 5 assigns the value 5 to the variable x.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use the "while" and "for" loops</summary>
<br>

>for: Iterate a predefined number of times. This is also known as a definite iteration  
while: Keep on iterating until the condition is false. This is known as an indefinite iteration
</details>
<details>
<summary>How is Python’s for different from "C"?</summary>
<br>

>C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language. Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Compiled programs execute faster as compared to interpreted programs
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use the "break" and "continues" statements</summary>
<br>

>"break" statement is used to exit a loop early, before the loop has finished all its iterations. "continue" statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next one. Both "break" and "continue" are used within the body of a loop and the execution of the loop is altered based on the statement used.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use "else" clauses on loops</summary>
<br>

>"else" clauses can be used in loops to specify a block of code that will be executed after the loop has finished, but only if the loop completed all its iterations without encountering a "break" statement.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What does the "pass" statement do, and when to use it</summary>
<br>

>The pass statement is used as a placeholder for future code. When the pass statement is executed, nothing happens, but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed. Empty code is not allowed in loops, function definitions, class definitions, or in if statements.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use "range"</summary>
<br>

>"range" is a built-in function in Python that generates a sequence of numbers. The basic syntax for using "range" is range(start, stop, step), where "start" is the first number in the sequence, "stop" is the last number in the sequence and "step" is the difference between each number in the sequence. The returned object is an iterator, which can be used in a for loop or converted to a list using the list() function.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is a function and how do you use functions</summary>
<br>

>Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They take input, return output, defined with "def" and are called by name with parameters in parentheses.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What does return a function that does not use any "return" statement</summary>
<br>

>A function that does not use any "return" statement will return "None" by default.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Scope of variables</summary>
<br>

>Scope of a variable refers to the region of the code where it can be accessed. Variables defined inside a function have a local scope and can only be accessed within that function. Variables defined outside of any function have a global scope and can be accessed throughout the program. A variable with the same name can exist in both the global and local scope, but the local variable will take precedence within the function.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What’s a traceback</summary>
<br>

>A traceback is a record of call stack at a certain point in time, showing the sequence of calls that led to an error, including line number and file name. Used for debugging.
</details>
<details>
<summary>What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them</summary>
<br>

>Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numbers.  
They include:
addition + (ex: 2 + 3)  
subtraction - (ex: 3 - 2)  
multiplication * (ex: 5 * 4)  
division / (ex: 10 / 2)  
modulus - % (returns the remainder of a division) (ex: 7 % 3)  
exponentiation ** (raises a number to a power) (ex: 2 ** 3)  
floor division // (returns the quotient of a division, rounded down to the nearest integer) (ex: 9 // 2)  
</details>

### [Python - Import & Modules](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/tree/main/0x02-python-import_modules)

#### `General`

<details>
<summary>How to import functions from another file</summary>
<br>

>Import functions from another file by using "import file_name" or "from file_name import function_name".
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use imported functions</summary>
<br>

>Use imported functions by referencing it with the imported file name and dot operator file_name.function_name() or directly function_name()
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to create a module</summary>
<br>

>To create a module in Python, create a .py file and define functions, variables, and other elements. To use the module in another file, use the import statement followed by the file name (without the .py extension).
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use the built-in function dir()</summary>
<br>

>The built-in function dir() lists all the names of the members of a module or object. It takes an object or module as an argument and returns a list of strings containing the names of the members of this object or module.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported</summary>
<br>

>To prevent code in your script from being executed when imported, use an if __name__ == "__main__": statement around your code. This code will only be executed when the script is run directly and not when it is imported.
</details>
<details>
<summary>How to use command line arguments with your Python programs</summary>
<br>

>To use command line arguments with your Python programs, use the sys library and access the sys.argv list. This list contains the command line arguments passed when the script is run.
