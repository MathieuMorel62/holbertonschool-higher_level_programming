## Description
>Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. It was first created in 1989 by Guido van Rossum. It is known for its clear and concise syntax, ease of use and large developer community. It is used in many fields such as data science, machine learning, robotics, web development, game development, etc. It is also used for developing scripts to automate common tasks and for creating small to medium-sized programs. Python supports multiple programming paradigms such as object-oriented programming, procedural programming and functional programming. It is also compatible with many operating systems including Windows, MacOS and Linux.
